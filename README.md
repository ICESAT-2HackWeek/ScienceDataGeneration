# Sample Project

This is as an example on how teams can structure their project repositories. Thanks to Lindsey Heagey and Joachim Meyer for the template, provided originally for [Geohackweek](https://github.com/geohackweek/sample_project_repository).

## Files

* `.gitignore`
<br> Globally ignored files by `git` for the project.
* `environment.yml`
<br> `conda` environment description needed to run this project.
* `README.md`
<br> Description of the project. [Sample](https://geohackweek.github.io/wiki/github_project_management.html#project-guidelines)

## Folders

### `contributors`
Each team member has it's own folder under contributors, where he/she can
work on their contribution. Having a dedicated folder for one-self helps to 
prevent conflicts when merging with master.

### `notebooks`
Notebooks that are considered delivered results for the project should go in
here.

### `scripts`
Helper utilities that are shared with the team
